# Geo Data Store

A WordPress plugin to store latitude and longitude information in a separate (and better optimized) table.

This plugin is a fork of the original (now unmaintained and not on GitHub available)
"Geo Data Store" plugin by Scott "l3rady" Carris _[home](http://l3rady.com/) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/l3rady)_.

Scott by now is possibly married and I wish him all the best.
